						<h2>Naruto</h2>
						<p>Naruto Uzumaki is the titular protagonist of the series. 
							He was the first character created by Kishimoto during the 
							conception of the series, and was designed with many traits 
							from other sh≈çnen characters. He is often ridiculed by the 
							Konohagakure villagers, as he is the host of Kurama, 
							the Nine-Tailed Fox that attacked Konoha.</p>

						<h2>Sasuke</h2>
						<p>Sasuke Uchiha is Naruto's rival. Designed by Kishimoto, 
						to be the "cool genius" he felt was an integral part of an ideal rivalry. 
						Sasuke's older brother, Itachi Uchiha, killed the rest of their family.
						Because of this, Sasuke's sole desire is to kill his brother.</p>

						While creating the character, Kishimoto has admitted that he had little 
						perception of what an ideal girl should be.As a child, Sakura was 
						teased by other children because of her large forehead, a feature Kishimoto 
						tried to emphasize in Sakura's appearance. </p>

						and spouse to Kushina Uzumaki. Although Naruto and Minato are noted 
						to have a number of similar physical traits throughout the series, 
						their familial relationship is not revealed until Part II of the series.He 
						was the student of Jiraiya and the teacher of Kakashi Hatake, Obito Uchiha,
						and Rin Nohara.</p>

						<h2>Kakashi</h2>
						<p>Kakashi Hatake is the leader of Team 7 and the sensei to Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura.
						Kishimoto had originally intended for Kakashi to be introduced earlier in the series than 
						he actually was, and created him as an easygoing person that would be able to keep 
						the members of Team 7 in check.[8] Kakashi treats his leadership position with 
						a mysterious, detached manner, and is consistently late to meetings as a result.</p>

						<h2>Jiraya</h2>
						<p>Jiraiya is a fictional character in the Naruto anime and manga 
						series created by Masashi Kishimoto. Introduced in the first half 
						of the series, he was a student of Hiruzen Sarutobi and one of the
						"Legendary Sannin"; along with Orochimaru and Lady Tsunade. 
						Jiraiya appears as a perverted old man who occasionally returns
						to the village, reporting the activities of Orochimaru and Akatsuki. </p>
